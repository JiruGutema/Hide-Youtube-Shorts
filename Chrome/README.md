## Why This Extension?

There is no way to bypass this rule of this extension. There are alternative extensions but they do not remove all Shorts and can be bypassed dynamically, for example using dynamic routes like `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/` or `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/abc123`, and redirecting `youtube/shorts`to `youtube/`. They also do not remove Shorts from the homepage, sidebar, and other places. This extension is designed to remove all of them.
